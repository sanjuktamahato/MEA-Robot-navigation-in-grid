# MEA-Robot-navigation-in-grid
MEA (Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm) robot navigation in a grid involves using evolutionary strategies to find optimal paths considering multiple goals like shortest distance, energy efficiency, and obstacle avoidance. It evolves path solutions in a grid-based environment to navigate from start to goal effectively.
